The project involves creating an automated data processing workflow using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) technologies. The main objectives of the project are to retrieve data, load it into BigQuery, and conduct sales analysis using SQL and data visualization tools. The project details are as follows:

Data Processing Automation:

Create a Python script that downloads CSV files from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/sfrechette/adventureworks-neo4j/tree/master/data ) and saves them in a pre-created Cloud Storage bucket.
The script then loads data from the CSV files into tables in BigQuery, creating a separate table for each file. The table name corresponds to the file name (excluding the extension).
Each row of the loaded data will include a technical column "inserted_at," which contains the timestamp of when the data was loaded.
All resources (bucket, table schema) should be located in the same GCP region.
The script can be run locally using a key from a previously created service account with the appropriate permissions for Cloud Storage and BigQuery.
Alternatively, the code can be run in a notebook on the Vertex AI platform. This requires creating a managed notebook in Vertex AI Workbench, in the same location as the bucket and dataset. Using an n1-standard-1 machine type is recommended.
Sales Data Analysis:

Utilize the loaded data to conduct analyses using SQL and present the results in a visualization tool, such as GCP Looker Studio.
The analyses include:
Total sales distribution (column "LineTotal") by product sub-categories.
Monthly aggregated sales, grouped by consecutive months.
The five largest individual purchases in each product category.
The project encompasses both data engineering and data analysis aspects, providing automated retrieval, processing, and visualization of information related to product sales.
